# OMRON ROS Robot driver
===
The OMRON LD-60 is a capable platform out of the box but does not natively support any ROS capabilities. Fortunately being a legacy platform built on Adepbt, built on MobileRobots, built on ActivMedia .... there is significant documentattion in the public domain and the LD-60 at heart is still really a Pioneer.
